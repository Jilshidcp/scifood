                        <p>This information will assist home and building owners in controlling infestation of pest insects plus a few other common home-invading arthropods. The important first step in the process of insect pest control is to identify the pests that are present so that the proper management procedures will be used. In house, we can usually control light infestations of pests by carefully following the directions on the pesticide containers. Sanitation and good housekeeping are possibly the most important aspect in controlling or preventing pests, but even well kept home sometimes become infected. <br>
The basics of controlling insects and other insects which attack man or his possession include recognition, understanding its life habits, determining the need for treatment or environmental/structural modification, pesticide selection, proper timing and application of pesticides and determining the need to treat again. General insect pests are discussed here
</p>
                            
                            <h5>Cockroaches</h5>
                            <p>Cockroaches are major pests in home, restaurants, hospitals, warehouses, offices and other structures with food handling areas. These insects can contaminate food and eating utensils, destroy fabric and paper products and impart stains and odors to the surface they contact.</p>
                            <h6>Management guidelines for cockroaches :</h6>
                            <p>The control of cockroaches requires a great deal of care and planning while taking care of our home. Careful Inspection is necessary to find their hiding places and to treat them thoroughly. Nighttime surveys are useful because cockroaches are active at night. Use a flashlight and search in cracks , under counters, around water heaters and in other dark locations. <br>
    Good sanitation is as important as the use of insecticides. Do not leave food exposed. Keep the garbage in closed containers and check fgog and cat foods because cockroaches can live on these alone. Eliminate dripping faucets, leaking water pipes and other sources of moisture. Keep sewer opening screened. Incoming merchandise, especially groceries and drink cartons, should be inspected for cockroaches and egg capsules. Unnecessary boxes and other trash should be discarded. <br>
    Control chemicals may be oil based sprays, water emulsion sprays, dust and for some species, baits. Choice of chemical frequently dependent on the situation requiring treatment. Dust may not be appropriate where they would be unsightly or cause contamination problems. Common residual problems include oil based or water emulsion sprays. These sprays should be applied to cockroach harborages with emphasis on cracks and crevices, and minimizing the treatment of exposed surfaces. Excess spray should be wiped out immediately to avoid staining or damaging certain materials. Other precautions include: <br>
</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>  Do not apply oil-based insecticides near open flames, to tile floors or on the plants.</li>
                                <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>  Do not use water based sprays near electrical outlets</li>
                                <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>  Remove pets and clover aquariums before spraying and allow treated surfaces to dry before dishes, foods, cooking utensils, or other items are placed on them.</li>
                                  
                            </ul>  
                    <p>No matter what type of insecticide is used,insecticide placed in or regular hiding places will give better control than those places where roaches will walk over them occasionally</p>

                <h5>Ants</h5>
                <p>Ants are among the most prevalent pests in households. Most ants can bite with their pincer like jaws,and they are annoying pests primarily because they appear in large numbers and may nest in wall voids or other parts of structures. Ants contaminate and destroy some agricultural products and stored foods. <br>
    The best control of ants can be achieved if the nest can be located and treated. Since ants nest both indoors and outdoors, we will deal with each location separately.
</p>
                <h6>Indoor ant management: </h6>
                <p>Certain species of ants are more likely to nest inside home. Control of these ants is more likely to be effective if the foraging workers can be traced to the nest. Forcing an insecticide dust into all cracks and crevices for several feet on each side of where the ants are seen is a good practice. Sometimes drilling small holes into voids for treatment is helpful. Treatment of baseboards, door molding and other cracks along the length of the wall from which ants are seen entering with residual sprays may be helpful in control for most of them. A small strip of floor adjacent to the wall should also be treated. This treatment should be applied on both the sides of the wall.</p>
                <h6>Outdoor ant management:</h6>
                <p>It is important to find their nest and to treat it heavily with residual sprays or dusts. If the dust is blown into the nest with force, it will generally be distributed throughout the nest. In case of large nests, it may help to pour two to five gallons of water into the opening after testing. Dry wettable powders can be sprinkled on the nest and washed in with a hose. With some mound-building species, it helps to break or scrape the mound before treatment. Besides treating the mounds, the walls through which the ants are entering should be given a barrier treatment with residual insecticides</p>

                <h5>Flies</h5>
                <p>Flies are typically found around or within structures and can become extremely annoying by their constant presence and ability to bite and transmit diseases. They also leave deposits of regurgitated food and excrement on walls, furniture, draperies, painting and other belongings. Flies are also pests in outdoor eating areas, open-air markets and home yards. There are several thousands of species of flies, only a few are persistent pests in or around buildings. <br>
    The basis for domestic fly control is the elimination or prevention of favourable habitats for fly production. The use of insecticides is the only secondary to sanitation and other practices in fly control. Habitats where flies breed cannot effectively be reached or penetrated by insecticides. Insecticide treatment at locations other than the site of breeding and development is at best only a temporary means of control. <br>
Fly control in the urban areas follows the same principles as that in rural areas. That is locate the breeding place or places of the population and eliminate the site. Once a breeding site has been eliminated, corrective actions should be taken to prevent the recurrence of the problem.
