    <h3>Are you planning to open a restaurant or a hotel?<br>
</h3>
      <p>Then here we have a list of commercial kitchen equipment used, that will help you to select suitable equipment for your kitchens. <br>
Cooking equipment used in kitchens are types of heat generating equipment,Cold generating equipment,Processing equipment,Holding and storing equipment, measuring devices,Knives,Hand tools and small equipment.
</p>
    <h3><b>Heat Generating Equipments</b></h3>
      <h4>Range Tops.</h4>
      <h4>Ovens</h4>
      <h4>Conventional Ovens</h4>
      <h4>Revolving Ovens</h4>
      <h4>Slow-Cook-and-Hold ovens</h4>
      <h4>Combination Steamer Ovens</h4>
      <h4>Barbecue Ovens or Smoke Ovens</h4>
      <h4>Infrared or Reconstituting Ovens</h4>
      <h4>Microwave Ovens</h4>
      <h4>Broilers and Salamanders</h4>
      <h4>Grills</h4>
      <h4>Griddles</h4>
      <h4>Rotisseries</h4>
      <h4>Deep Fryers</h4>
      <h4>Tilting Skillet</h4>
      <h4>Steam-Jacketed Kettles</h4>
      <h4>Steam Cookers</h4>
    <h3><b>Cold Generating Equipment</b></h3>
      <h4>Walk-in/Cold Storage</h4>
      <h4>Freezer/Deep Freezer</h4>
      <h4>Blast Chilling Equipment</h4>
    <h3><b>Processing Equipments</b></h3>
      <h4>Mixers</h4>
      <h4>Food Cutter</h4>
      <h4>Slicer</h4>
      <h4>Vertical Cutter/Mixer</h4>
    <h3><b>Holding & Storage Equipment</b></h3>
      <p>1. Steam tables are standard holding equipment for serving lines. Standard-size
counter pans or hotel pans are used as inserts to hold the foods. Flat or domed covers
may be used to cover the foods. <br>

2. A bain marie is a hot water bath. Containers of foods are set on a rack in a
shallow container of water, which is heated by electricity, gas, or steam. The bain
marie is used more in the production area, while the steam table is used in the service
area. <br>

3. Overhead infrared lamps are used in service areas to keep plated food warm
before it is picked up by the service staff. They are also used for keeping large roasts
warm. <br>

b) Cold Food Storage Equipment. The quality of the food you serve depends to a
great degree on refrigeration equipment. By keeping foods cold, usually below 40oF
(5oC), the refrigerator (known in the trade as the ‘cooler’ or the ‘box’) guards against
spoilage and bacterial growth. Freezers are used to hold foods for longer times, or to
store foods purchased in frozen form. <br>

    <h3><b>Measuring Devices</b></h3>
      <p>1. Scales: most recipe ingredients are measured by weight, so accurate scales are
very important. Portion scales are used for measuring ingredients as well as for
portioning products for service. <br>

2. Volume measures used for liquids have lips for easy pouring. Sizes are pints,
quarts, half gallons, and gallons. Each size is marked off into fourths by ridges on the
sides. <br>

3. Measuring cups are available in 1-, ½ -, 1/3-, and ¼ -cup sizes. They can be
used for both liquid and dry measures. <br>

4. Measuring spoons are used for measuring very small volumes: 1 tablespoon,
½ teaspoon, and ¼ teaspoon. They are used most often for spices and seasonings. <br>

5. Ladles are used for measuring and portioning liquids. The size, in ounces, is
stamped on the handle. <br>

6. Scoops come in standard sizes and have a lever for mechanical release. They
are used for portioning soft solid foods. The number of the scoop indicates the
number of level scoop-fuls per quart (or litre). In actual use a rounded scoop-ful is
often more practical, so exact weights will vary. <br>

7. Thermometers measure temperatures. There are many kinds for many
purposes. <br>
</p>
    <h3><b>Knives, Hand Tools & Small Equipments</b></h3>
      <p>1. French knives or chef’s knife – Most frequently used knife in the kitchen, for
